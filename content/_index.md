Hello! I'm Lucia, and I'm a 17 year old software developer! I mostly work with C++, where I make mods for flash games!! I'm mostly interested in [compiler design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compiler), [reverse engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_engineering), and [robotics](https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/frc), but I'm interested in a very broad range of topics. You can see my software setup [here!](setup)
